    price: "N12,540,000",
    description: "According to Autotrader, to be considered for a spot on the top 10 list, EVs have to be from the 2023 model year, have an MSRP of under $100,000, and be generally available to the public in at least 15 states. However, this doesnâ€™t mean they automatically get a spot on the list, as the editorial team has to weigh in and score every vehicle separately.",
